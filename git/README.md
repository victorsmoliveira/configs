# Instructions

Open your `.gitconfig` file and add the aliases to the `[alias]` section, creating one if you don't have it already.

## Where is my .gitconfig file?

It depends on your operating system:

| Operating System | Location |
|-----------------|----------|
| Windows         | `C:\Users\<your_username>\.gitconfig` |
| macOS           | `/Users/<your_username>/.gitconfig` |
| Linux           | `/home/<your_username>/.gitconfig` |
